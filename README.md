Trace Generator
=========
The Trace Generator plug-in allows the user to generate a set of traces from the selected template. A trace is a sequence of labels obtained to go from the initial state, a LTS or PLTS, choosing each state a transition, to find a final state. If the model is probabilistic, the choice of which make transition is made according to probability of occurrence. Otherwise, the choice is made not deterministically. The user can determine the amount of generated traces and save them in a cvs file type.
